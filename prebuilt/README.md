# Prebuilt Binaries

These are binaries that deno needs for various purposes that would take too long
to build from scratch during CI. It is possible to opt out of using these
binaries using these binaries. See the build instructions in the manual:
https://deno.land/manual

TODO(ry) clang_format can also be put here.
