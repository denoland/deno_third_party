//! Types which pin data to its location in memory
//!
//! It is sometimes useful to have objects that are guaranteed to not move,
//! in the sense that their placement in memory does not change, and can thus be relied upon.
//!
//! A prime example of such a scenario would be building self-referential structs,
//! since moving an object with pointers to itself will invalidate them,
//! which could cause undefined behavior.
//!
//! By default, all types in Rust are movable. Rust allows passing all types by-value,
//! and common smart-pointer types such as `Box`, `Rc`, and `&mut` allow replacing and
//! moving the values they contain. In order to prevent objects from moving, they must
//! be pinned by wrapping a pointer to the data in the [`Pin`] type.
//! Doing this prohibits moving the value behind the pointer.
//! For example, `Pin<Box<T>>` functions much like a regular `Box<T>`,
//! but doesn't allow moving `T`. The pointer value itself (the `Box`) can still be moved,
//! but the value behind it cannot.
//!
//! Since data can be moved out of `&mut` and `Box` with functions such as [`swap`],
//! changing the location of the underlying data, [`Pin`] prohibits accessing the
//! underlying pointer type (the `&mut` or `Box`) directly, and provides its own set of
//! APIs for accessing and using the value. [`Pin`] also guarantees that no other
//! functions will move the pointed-to value. This allows for the creation of
//! self-references and other special behaviors that are only possible for unmovable
//! values.
//!
//! However, these restrictions are usually not necessary. Many types are always freely
//! movable. These types implement the [`Unpin`] auto-trait, which nullifies the effect
//! of [`Pin`]. For `T: Unpin`, `Pin<Box<T>>` and `Box<T>` function identically, as do
//! `Pin<&mut T>` and `&mut T`.
//!
//! Note that pinning and `Unpin` only affect the pointed-to type. For example, whether
//! or not `Box<T>` is `Unpin` has no affect on the behavior of `Pin<Box<T>>`. Similarly,
//! `Pin<Box<T>>` and `Pin<&mut T>` are always `Unpin` themselves, even though the
//! `T` underneath them isn't, because the pointers in `Pin<Box<_>>` and `Pin<&mut _>`
//! are always freely movable, even if the data they point to isn't.
//!
//! [`Pin`]: struct.Pin.html
//! [`Unpin`]: ../../std/marker/trait.Unpin.html
//! [`swap`]: ../../std/mem/fn.swap.html
//! [`Box`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::pin::Pin;
//! use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
//! use std::ptr::NonNull;
//!
//! // This is a self-referential struct since the slice field points to the data field.
//! // We cannot inform the compiler about that with a normal reference,
//! // since this pattern cannot be described with the usual borrowing rules.
//! // Instead we use a raw pointer, though one which is known to not be null,
//! // since we know it's pointing at the string.
//! struct Unmovable {
//!     data: String,
//!     slice: NonNull<String>,
//!     _pin: PhantomPinned,
//! }
//!
//! impl Unmovable {
//!     // To ensure the data doesn't move when the function returns,
//!     // we place it in the heap where it will stay for the lifetime of the object,
//!     // and the only way to access it would be through a pointer to it.
//!     fn new(data: String) -> Pin<Box<Self>> {
//!         let res = Unmovable {
//!             data,
//!             // we only create the pointer once the data is in place
//!             // otherwise it will have already moved before we even started
//!             slice: NonNull::dangling(),
//!             _pin: PhantomPinned,
//!         };
//!         let mut boxed = Box::pin(res);
//!
//!         let slice = NonNull::from(&boxed.data);
//!         // we know this is safe because modifying a field doesn't move the whole struct
//!         unsafe {
//!             let mut_ref: Pin<&mut Self> = Pin::as_mut(&mut boxed);
//!             Pin::get_unchecked_mut(mut_ref).slice = slice;
//!         }
//!         boxed
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let unmoved = Unmovable::new("hello".to_string());
//! // The pointer should point to the correct location,
//! // so long as the struct hasn't moved.
//! // Meanwhile, we are free to move the pointer around.
//! # #[allow(unused_mut)]
//! let mut still_unmoved = unmoved;
//! assert_eq!(still_unmoved.slice, NonNull::from(&still_unmoved.data));
//!
//! // Since our type doesn't implement Unpin, this will fail to compile:
//! // let new_unmoved = Unmovable::new("world".to_string());
//! // std::mem::swap(&mut *still_unmoved, &mut *new_unmoved);
//! ```
