/// Takes ownership and "forgets" about the value **without running its destructor**.
///
/// Any resources the value manages, such as heap memory or a file handle, will linger
/// forever in an unreachable state. However, it does not guarantee that pointers
/// to this memory will remain valid.
///
/// * If you want to leak memory, see [`Box::leak`][leak].
/// * If you want to obtain a raw pointer to the memory, see [`Box::into_raw`][into_raw].
/// * If you want to dispose of a value properly, running its destructor, see
/// [`mem::drop`][drop].
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `forget` is not marked as `unsafe`, because Rust's safety guarantees
/// do not include a guarantee that destructors will always run. For example,
/// a program can create a reference cycle using [`Rc`][rc], or call
/// [`process::exit`][exit] to exit without running destructors. Thus, allowing
/// `mem::forget` from safe code does not fundamentally change Rust's safety
/// guarantees.
///
/// That said, leaking resources such as memory or I/O objects is usually undesirable,
/// so `forget` is only recommended for specialized use cases like those shown below.
///
/// Because forgetting a value is allowed, any `unsafe` code you write must
/// allow for this possibility. You cannot return a value and expect that the
/// caller will necessarily run the value's destructor.
///
/// [rc]: ../../std/rc/struct.Rc.html
/// [exit]: ../../std/process/fn.exit.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Leak an I/O object, never closing the file:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::fs::File;
///
/// let file = File::open("foo.txt").unwrap();
/// mem::forget(file);
/// ```
///
/// The practical use cases for `forget` are rather specialized and mainly come
/// up in unsafe or FFI code.
///
/// ## Use case 1
///
/// You have created an uninitialized value using [`mem::uninitialized`][uninit].
/// You must either initialize or `forget` it on every computation path before
/// Rust drops it automatically, like at the end of a scope or after a panic.
/// Running the destructor on an uninitialized value would be [undefined behavior][ub].
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// # let some_condition = false;
/// unsafe {
///     let mut uninit_vec: Vec<u32> = mem::uninitialized();
///
///     if some_condition {
///         // Initialize the variable.
///         ptr::write(&mut uninit_vec, Vec::new());
///     } else {
///         // Forget the uninitialized value so its destructor doesn't run.
///         mem::forget(uninit_vec);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Use case 2
///
/// You have duplicated the bytes making up a value, without doing a proper
/// [`Clone`][clone]. You need the value's destructor to run only once,
/// because a double `free` is undefined behavior.
///
/// An example is a possible implementation of [`mem::swap`][swap]:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]
/// fn swap<T>(x: &mut T, y: &mut T) {
///     unsafe {
///         // Give ourselves some scratch space to work with
///         let mut t: T = mem::uninitialized();
///
///         // Perform the swap, `&mut` pointers never alias
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&*x, &mut t, 1);
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&*y, x, 1);
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&t, y, 1);
///
///         // y and t now point to the same thing, but we need to completely
///         // forget `t` because we do not want to run the destructor for `T`
///         // on its value, which is still owned somewhere outside this function.
///         mem::forget(t);
///     }

/// More specifically, this is the offset in bytes between successive elements
/// in an array with that item type including alignment padding. Thus, for any
/// type `T` and length `n`, `[T; n]` has a size of `n * size_of::<T>()`.
///
/// In general, the size of a type is not stable across compilations, but
/// specific types such as primitives are.
///
/// The following table gives the size for primitives.
///
/// Type | size_of::\<Type>()
/// ---- | ---------------
/// () | 0
/// bool | 1
/// u8 | 1

///

/// The types `*const T`, `&T`, `Box<T>`, `Option<&T>`, and `Option<Box<T>>` all have
/// the same size. If `T` is Sized, all of those types have the same size as `usize`.
///
/// The mutability of a pointer does not change its size. As such, `&T` and `&mut T`
/// have the same size. Likewise for `*const T` and `*mut T`.
///
/// # Size of `#[repr(C)]` items
///
/// The `C` representation for items has a defined layout. With this layout,
/// the size of items is also stable as long as all fields have a stable size.
///
/// ## Size of Structs
///
/// For `structs`, the size is determined by the following algorithm.
///
/// For each field in the struct ordered by declaration order:
///
/// 1. Add the size of the field.
/// 2. Round up the current size to the nearest multiple of the next field's [alignment].
///
/// Finally, round the size of the struct to the nearest multiple of its [alignment].
/// The alignment of the struct is usually the largest alignment of all its
/// fields; this can be changed with the use of `repr(align(N))`.
///
/// Unlike `C`, zero sized structs are not rounded up to one byte in size.
///
/// ## Size of Enums
///
/// Enums that carry no data other than the discriminant have the same size as C enums
/// on the platform they are compiled for.
///
/// ## Size of Unions
///
/// The size of a union is the size of its largest field.
///
/// Unlike `C`, zero sized unions are not rounded up to one byte in size.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
///
/// // Some primitives
/// assert_eq!(4, mem::size_of::<i32>());
/// assert_eq!(8, mem::size_of::<f64>());
/// assert_eq!(0, mem::size_of::<()>());
///
/// // Some arrays
/// assert_eq!(8, mem::size_of::<[i32; 2]>());
/// assert_eq!(12, mem::size_of::<[i32; 3]>());
/// assert_eq!(0, mem::size_of::<[i32; 0]>());
///
///
/// // Pointer size equality
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of::<&i32>(), mem::size_of::<*const i32>());
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of::<&i32>(), mem::size_of::<Box<i32>>());
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of::<&i32>(), mem::size_of::<Option<&i32>>());

///
/// ```

///
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct FieldStruct {
///     first: u8,
///     second: u16,
///     third: u8
/// }
///
/// // The size of the first field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 1.
/// // The alignment of the second field is 2, so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 2.
/// // The size of the second field is 2, so add 2 to the size. Size is 4.
/// // The alignment of the third field is 1, so add 0 to the size for padding. Size is 4.

/// If the value does implement [`Drop`], it must be initialized before

/// If you partially initialize an array, you may need to use

/// initialized followed by [`mem::forget`][mem_forget] to prevent drop running
/// on the array. If a partially allocated array is dropped this will lead to

///
/// # Examples
///
/// Here's how to safely initialize an array of [`Vec`]s.
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// // Only declare the array. This safely leaves it
/// // uninitialized in a way that Rust will track for us.
/// // However we can't initialize it element-by-element
/// // safely, and we can't use the `[value; 1000]`
/// // constructor because it only works with `Copy` data.
/// let mut data: [Vec<u32>; 1000];
///
/// unsafe {
///     // So we need to do this to initialize it.
///     data = mem::uninitialized();
///
///     // DANGER ZONE: if anything panics or otherwise
///     // incorrectly reads the array here, we will have
///     // Undefined Behavior.
///
///     // It's ok to mutably iterate the data, since this
///     // doesn't involve reading it at all.
///     // (ptr and len are statically known for arrays)
///     for elem in &mut data[..] {
///         // *elem = Vec::new() would try to drop the
///         // uninitialized memory at `elem` -- bad!
///         //
///         // Vec::new doesn't allocate or do really
///         // anything. It's only safe to call here
///         // because we know it won't panic.
///         ptr::write(elem, Vec::new());
///     }
///
///     // SAFE ZONE: everything is initialized.
/// }
///
/// println!("{:?}", &data[0]);
/// ```
///
/// This example emphasizes exactly how delicate and dangerous using `mem::uninitialized`
/// can be. Note that the [`vec!`] macro *does* let you initialize every element with a

///
/// ```
/// let data: Vec<Vec<u32>> = vec![Vec::new(); 1000];
