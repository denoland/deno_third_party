//! rustc compiler intrinsics.
//!
//! The corresponding definitions are in librustc_codegen_llvm/intrinsic.rs.
//!
//! # Volatiles
//!
//! The volatile intrinsics provide operations intended to act on I/O
//! memory, which are guaranteed to not be reordered by the compiler
//! across other volatile intrinsics. See the LLVM documentation on
//! [[volatile]].
//!
//! [volatile]: http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#volatile-memory-accesses
//!
//! # Atomics
//!
//! The atomic intrinsics provide common atomic operations on machine
//! words, with multiple possible memory orderings. They obey the same
//! semantics as C++11. See the LLVM documentation on [[atomics]].
//!
//! [atomics]: http://llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html
//!
//! A quick refresher on memory ordering:
//!
//! * Acquire - a barrier for acquiring a lock. Subsequent reads and writes
//!   take place after the barrier.
//! * Release - a barrier for releasing a lock. Preceding reads and writes
//!   take place before the barrier.
//! * Sequentially consistent - sequentially consistent operations are
//!   guaranteed to happen in order. This is the standard mode for working
//!   with atomic types and is equivalent to Java's `volatile`.
