  --> $DIR/borrowck-partial-reinit-2.rs:15:5
   |
LL |     let mut u = Test { a: 2, b: Some(Box::new(t))};
   |                                               - value moved here
LL |     t.b = Some(Box::new(u));
   |     ^^^ value assigned here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `t` has type `Test`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
