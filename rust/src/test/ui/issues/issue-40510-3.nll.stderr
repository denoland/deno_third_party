   | |_________^ returns a closure that contains a reference to a captured variable, which then escapes the closure body

   = note: `FnMut` closures only have access to their captured variables while they are executing...
   = note: ...therefore, they cannot allow references to captured variables to escape
   = warning: this error has been downgraded to a warning for backwards compatibility with previous releases
   = warning: this represents potential undefined behavior in your code and this warning will become a hard error in the future
