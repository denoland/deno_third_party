LL |     let ref my_ref @ _ = 0;
   |         -------------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `ref mut my_ref @ _`
LL |     *my_ref = 0; //~ ERROR cannot assign to immutable borrowed content `*my_ref` [E0594]
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ `my_ref` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be written
