// Issue 27282: This is a variation on issue-27282-move-ref-mut-into-guard.rs
//
// It reborrows instead of moving the `ref mut` pattern borrow. This
// means that our conservative check for mutation in guards will
// reject it. But I want to make sure that we continue to reject it
// (under NLL) even when that conservaive check goes away.
