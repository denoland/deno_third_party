error[E0382]: use of moved value: `range`
  --> $DIR/issue-51512.rs:7:13
   |
LL |     let r = range;
   |             ----- value moved here
LL |     let x = range.start;
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `range` has type `std::ops::Range<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

error: aborting due to previous error
