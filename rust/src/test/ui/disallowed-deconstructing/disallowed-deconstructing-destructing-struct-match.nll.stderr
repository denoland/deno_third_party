error[E0509]: cannot move out of type `X`, which implements the `Drop` trait
  --> $DIR/disallowed-deconstructing-destructing-struct-match.rs:14:11

LL |     match x {

LL |         X { x: y } => println!("contents: {}", y)

note: move occurs because `y` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
