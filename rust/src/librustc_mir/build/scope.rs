/*!
Managing the scope stack. The scopes are tied to lexical scopes, so as
we descend the HAIR, we push a scope on the stack, build its
contents, and then pop it off. Every scope is named by a
`region::Scope`.

### SEME Regions

When pushing a new scope, we record the current point in the graph (a
basic block); this marks the entry to the scope. We then generate more
stuff in the control-flow graph. Whenever the scope is exited, either
via a `break` or `return` or just by fallthrough, that marks an exit
from the scope. Each lexical scope thus corresponds to a single-entry,
multiple-exit (SEME) region in the control-flow graph.

For now, we keep a mapping from each `region::Scope` to its
corresponding SEME region for later reference (see caveat in next
paragraph). This is because region scopes are tied to
them. Eventually, when we shift to non-lexical lifetimes, there should
be no need to remember this mapping.

There is one additional wrinkle, actually, that I wanted to hide from
you but duty compels me to mention. In the course of building
matches, it sometimes happen that certain code (namely guards) gets
executed multiple times. This means that the scope lexical scope may
in fact correspond to multiple, disjoint SEME regions. So in fact our
mapping is from one scope to a vector of SEME regions.

### Drops

The primary purpose for scopes is to insert drops: while building
the contents, we also accumulate places that need to be dropped upon
exit from each scope. This is done by calling `schedule_drop`. Once a
drop is scheduled, whenever we branch out we will insert drops of all
those places onto the outgoing edge. Note that we don't know the full
set of scheduled drops up front, and so whenever we exit from the
scope we only drop the values scheduled thus far. For example, consider
the scope S corresponding to this loop:

```
# let cond = true;
loop {
    let x = ..;
    if cond { break; }
    let y = ..;
}
```

When processing the `let x`, we will add one drop to the scope for
`x`.  The break will then insert a drop for `x`. When we process `let
y`, we will add another drop (in fact, to a subscope, but let's ignore
that for now); any later drops would also drop `y`.

### Early exit

There are numerous "normal" ways to early exit a scope: `break`,
`continue`, `return` (panics are handled separately). Whenever an
early exit occurs, the method `exit_scope` is called. It is given the
current point in execution where the early exit occurs, as well as the
scope you want to branch to (note that all early exits from to some
other enclosing scope). `exit_scope` will record this exit point and
also add all drops.

Panics are handled in a similar fashion, except that a panic always
returns out to the `DIVERGE_BLOCK`. To trigger a panic, simply call
`panic(p)` with the current point `p`. Or else you can call
`diverge_cleanup`, which will produce a block that you can branch to
which does the appropriate cleanup and then diverges. `panic(p)`
simply calls `diverge_cleanup()` and adds an edge from `p` to the
result.

### Loop scopes

In addition to the normal scope stack, we track a loop scope stack
that contains only loops. It tracks where a `break` and `continue`
should go to.
