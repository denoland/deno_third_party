//! Platform-specific types, as defined by C.
//!
//! Code that interacts via FFI will almost certainly be using the
//! base types provided by C, which aren't nearly as nicely defined
//! as Rust's primitive types. This module provides types which will
//! match those defined by C, so that code that interacts with C will
//! refer to the correct types.
