//! Standard library macros
//!
//! This modules contains a set of macros which are exported from the standard
//! library. Each macro is available for use when linking against the standard
//! library.

/// The entry point for panic of Rust threads.
///
/// This allows a program to terminate immediately and provide feedback
/// to the caller of the program. `panic!` should be used when a program reaches
/// an unrecoverable problem.
///
/// This macro is the perfect way to assert conditions in example code and in
/// tests.  `panic!` is closely tied with the `unwrap` method of both [`Option`]
/// and [`Result`][runwrap] enums.  Both implementations call `panic!` when they are set
/// to None or Err variants.
///
/// This macro is used to inject panic into a Rust thread, causing the thread to
/// panic entirely. Each thread's panic can be reaped as the `Box<Any>` type,
/// and the single-argument form of the `panic!` macro will be the value which
/// is transmitted.
///
/// [`Result`] enum is often a better solution for recovering from errors than
/// using the `panic!` macro.  This macro should be used to avoid proceeding using
/// incorrect values, such as from external sources. Detailed information about
/// error handling is found in the [book].
///
/// The multi-argument form of this macro panics with a string and has the
/// [`format!`] syntax for building a string.
///
/// See also the macro [`compile_error!`], for raising errors during compilation.
///
/// [runwrap]: ../std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap

/// [`format!`]: ../std/macro.format.html
/// [`compile_error!`]: ../std/macro.compile_error.html
/// [book]: ../book/ch09-00-error-handling.html
///
/// # Current implementation
///
/// If the main thread panics it will terminate all your threads and end your
/// program with code `101`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```should_panic
/// # #![allow(unreachable_code)]
/// panic!();
/// panic!("this is a terrible mistake!");
/// panic!(4); // panic with the value of 4 to be collected elsewhere
/// panic!("this is a {} {message}", "fancy", message = "message");

/// let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;
/// //      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4

/// of the expression.
///
/// Invoking the macro on an expression moves and takes ownership of it
/// before returning the evaluated expression unchanged. If the type
/// of the expression does not implement `Copy` and you don't want
/// to give up ownership, you can instead borrow with `dbg!(&expr)`
/// for some expression `expr`.
///
/// Note that the macro is intended as a debugging tool and therefore you
/// should avoid having uses of it in version control for longer periods.
/// Use cases involving debug output that should be added to version control
/// may be better served by macros such as `debug!` from the `log` crate.

/// and is subject to future changes.

///     if let Some(_) = dbg!(n.checked_sub(4)) {
///         // ...
///     }
/// }
///
/// foo(3)
/// ```
///
/// This prints to [stderr]:
///
/// ```text,ignore
/// [src/main.rs:4] n.checked_sub(4) = None
/// ```
///
/// Naive factorial implementation:
///
/// ```rust
/// fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
///     if dbg!(n <= 1) {
///         dbg!(1)
///     } else {
///         dbg!(n * factorial(n - 1))
///     }
/// }
///
/// dbg!(factorial(4));
/// ```
