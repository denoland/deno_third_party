### FEATURES #################################################################

[features]
default = ["std"]

# Re-export the derive(Serialize, Deserialize) macros. This is intended for
# library crates that provide optional Serde impls behind a Cargo cfg of their
# own.
#
# Mainly this is a workaround for limitations associated with
# rust-lang/cargo#1286 in which a library crate cannot use one "serde" cfg in
# Cargo to enable dependencies on both serde and serde_derive crates.
#
# The recommended way to provide optional Serde support that requires derive is
# as follows. In particular, please do not name your library's Serde feature
# anything other than "serde".
#
#     [dependencies]
#     serde = { version = "1.0", optional = true, features = ["derive"] }
#
# Within the library, these optional Serde derives would be written like this.
#
#     #[cfg(feature = "serde")]
#     #[macro_use]
#     extern crate serde;
#
#     #[cfg_attr(feature = "serde", derive(Serialize, Deserialize))]
#     struct ...
#
derive = ["serde_derive"]

# Provide impls for common standard library types like Vec<T> and HashMap<K, V>.
# Requires a dependency on the Rust standard library.
std = []

# Provide impls for types that require unstable functionality. For tracking and
# discussion of unstable functionality please refer to this issue:
#
#    https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/812
unstable = []

# Provide impls for types in the Rust core allocation and collections library
# including String, Box<T>, Vec<T>, and Cow<T>. This is a subset of std but may
# be enabled without depending on all of std.
#
# Requires a dependency on the unstable core allocation library:
#
#    https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/
alloc = ["unstable"]

# Opt into impls for Rc<T> and Arc<T>. Serializing and deserializing these types
# does not preserve identity and may result in multiple copies of the same data.
# Be sure that this is what you want before enabling this feature.
